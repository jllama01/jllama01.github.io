This is my first assignment for Comp20, which in ¡ncludes the use of Git, Github, HTML, and CSS. I correctly created an index.html in my homework.cs home directory that redirects to my github main page. My index page contains links that redirect to my bio and my résumé. All content in the websites is correctly coded in an HTML file and validated for errors. All styling is in a separate css file with at least 5 rules. I added, committed, and pushed accordingly with helpful messages. I attended office hours once to receive help about my index.html pages. My girlfriend Sara gave her opinion about styling and helped me decide on a color for the background. I used an image from SoloLearn, an online programming learning tool. The picture was found at https://www.sololearn.com/Uploads/header.jpg. Small inquiries about syntax and errors were looked up in StackOverflow and W3schools.com. I spent about 10-15 hours in this project.
